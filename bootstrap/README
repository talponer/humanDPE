# Bootstrap analysis of human promoter classes

Primary input file:

Complete promoter sequence set in R-friendly format, from -50 to +51

   ./data/hg19_epd05.dat

Secondary input files: 

Resampled subsets, from -10 to +41

   ./data/hg19_epd05_s0.dat   (complete set)
   ./data/hg19_epd05_s1.dat   (resampled set 1)
     ...
   ./data/hg19_epd05_s10.dat  (resampled set 10)

Intermediate results: 

Results from stage 1 of extended algorithms (300 motifs for each round)

   ./results/hg19_epd05_K6_s14_s0.dat
   ./results/hg19_epd05_K6_s14_s1.dat
     ... 
   ./results/hg19_epd05_K6_s14_s10.dat

Final results: 

Results from stage 2 of extended algorithm (10 best motifs)

  ./results/hg19_epd05_C10_s14_s0.dat 
  ./results/hg19_epd05_C10_s14_s1.dat 
    ...
  ./results/hg19_epd05_C10_s14_s10.dat 

Analysis:
