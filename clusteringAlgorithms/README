Partitioning of Drosophila and human promoter sequences:

Primary input files: 

   dm6_epd05.sga
   hg19_epd05.sga
   dm6_epd05.seq
   hg19_epd05.seq

Scripts: 

   driver.sh (driver script generating all other files from input file
   seq2mono.pl (fasta to R-friendly, numerical sequence format)

   Philipp_em2_functions.R (library of EM functions)
   
   dm6_epd05_em1.R   3-fold paritioning of Dm promoters with basic algorithm
   dm6_epd05_em2.R   6-fold paritioning of Dm promoters with new algorithm
   hg19_epd05_em1.R  3-paritioning of human promoters with basic algorithm
   hg19_epd05_em2.R  6-paritioning of human promoters with new algorithm

Notes: All four scripts are based on the same template. The basic algorithm 
is implemented as a special case of the new algorithm, with the consequence
that the code is over-kill (ovely complicated) for the basic algorithm. 

The new alglrithm uses a two-stage strategy. During the first stage, 
a large number of motis are collected by multiple rounds of clustering.
Then, during the second round these motifs are clusterd using 
hiearchical clustering, subclasses are defined by cutting the tree 
at a particular height, and the k most abundant classes are retained

Secondary input files (sequences R-friendly format)

 - dm6_epd05.dat
 - hg19_epd05.dat

Primary output files:

 - dm6_epd05_classes.sga   3-fold classification of Drosophila prometers
 - hg19_epd05_classes.sga  6-fold classification of human promoters

   The class affilication appears in the last field.

Subdirectories

 ./img 

   sequence Logos for the promoter subclasses: 
   example: cons_hg19_K6_s1_003_3.00.jpg 
   Note that the last element of the name (just before 
   the extension .jpg) indicates the frequency (%) of the 
   class.

 ./results

 - all-in-one clustering output files from stage 1.
   example: hg19_K6_s1.dat.
   One row corresponds to subclass. The first element contains 
   the probability of the subclass. The follwing 4 elements the 
   base composition at the first sequence position, etc. 
 - all-in-one clustering output files from stage 2.
   example: cons_hg19_K6_s1.dat
 - base probability matrices (N x 4) for classes
